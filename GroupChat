So, it has been a year since I have worked on any of this stuff so I am a little rusty... but I
guess for now I will organize it this way.
I'm gonna put in objectives in the Tasks file. Also, I am thinking this could be the chat room
of sorts. Now this is all subject to change and by all means let me know if we can do things in a
 better way.

I think that is all I got for now but I'm sure things will come up. I want to thank you again for
helping me with this. Like I don't thin this could be done with my lack of coding knowledge...
So until further development just enjoy the splendor that is github and I'll be always ready to
listen.
