So, it has been a year since I have worked on any of this stuff so I am a little rusty... but I
guess for now I will organize it this way.
I'm gonna put in objectives in the Tasks file. Also, I am thinking this could be the chat room
of sorts. Now this is all subject to change and by all means let me know if we can do things in a
 better way.

I think that is all I got for now but I'm sure things will come up. I want to thank you again for
helping me with this. Like I don't thin this could be done with my lack of coding knowledge...
So until further development just enjoy the splendor that is github and I'll be always ready to
listen.

Give some files and the game maker thing. I must know what i am dealing with here.

So this is the code in the create event (Horizontal speed, Vertical speed, and the Direction the character points)

hsp = 0; 
vsp = 0;
direction = 0;

"This is the initial step event" (I have everything labeled in the code)

key_left = keyboard_check(vk_left) or keyboard_check(ord("A"));
key_right = keyboard_check(vk_right) or keyboard_check(ord("D"));
key_up = keyboard_check(vk_up)or keyboard_check(ord("W"));
key_down = keyboard_check(vk_down)or keyboard_check(ord("S"));

//Calculate Movement//

//Right//

if (keyboard_check(vk_left) or keyboard_check(ord("A")))
{
		key_left = 2;
		direction = 2;
}
else
{
	key_left = 0;
}

//Left// 

if (keyboard_check(vk_right) or keyboard_check(ord("D")))
{
	key_right = 2;
	direction = 4;
}
else
{
	key_right = 0;
}

//Up//

if (keyboard_check(vk_up)or keyboard_check(ord("W")))
{
	key_up = -2;
	direction = 3;
}
else
{
	key_up = 0;
}

//Down//

if (keyboard_check(vk_down)or keyboard_check(ord("S")))
{
	key_down = -2;
	direction = 1;
}
else
{
	key_down = 0;
}

//Horizontal/Vertical Movement//

hsp = key_right - key_left;

vsp = key_up - key_down;

//Horizontal Collision//

if (place_meeting(x + hsp,y,o_Test_Wall))
{
	while (!place_meeting(x + sign(hsp),y,o_Test_Wall))
	{
		x = x + sign(hsp);
	}
	hsp = 0;
}

//Vertical Collision//

if (place_meeting(x,y + vsp,o_Test_Wall))
{
	while (!place_meeting(x,y + sign(vsp),o_Test_Wall))
	{
		y = y + sign(vsp);
	}
	vsp = 0;
}

x = x + hsp;

y = y + vsp;

// Walking Animation//

if (hsp + vsp != 0)
{
	image_speed = 1;
	if (direction == 1 and key_down = -2)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_ForwardWalk;
	}
	if (direction == 2 and key_left = 2)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_SidewaysWalk;
		image_xscale = -1;
	}
	if (direction == 3 and key_up = -2)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_Faceawaywalk;
	}
	if (direction == 4 and key_right = 2)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_SidewaysWalk;
		image_xscale = 1;
	}
}
else
{
		
	if (direction == 1)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_ForwardStand;
	}
	if (direction == 2)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_SidewaysStand;
		image_xscale = -1;
	}
	if (direction == 3)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_FaceawayStand;
	}
	if (direction == 4)
	{
		sprite_index = sHamble_SidewaysStand;
		image_xscale = 1;
	}
}

//Swing Normal Sword// 

if (hsp + vsp = 0 and mouse_check_button_pressed(mb_left))
{
	image_speed = 1;
	if (direction == 4)
	{
		
		sprite_index = sHamble_SidewaysSwing;
		image_xscale = 1;
		
	}
	if  (direction ==2)
	{
		
		sprite_index = sHamble_SidewaysSwing;
		image_xscale = -1;
		
	}
}

Right now I am only testing the characters collision with a dummy wall just to get basic 
functionality and it works really well. The only issue seems to be when the player presses two 
directional keys (say left and down) and the sprite seems to lock up and not be able to decide 
what it wants to choose. I have been toying with giving it the option to choose a direction based 
on hsp and vsp values but nothing concrete seems to come to mind. Also as a side note if you 
want the sprites let me know cuz I am currently trying to find a way to upload them to github

Also, if you havent bought gamemaker I think I have the installer on my flashdrive so if you 
wanna wait untill we work together again or something I can give it to you. You could always try
using my login :/

But thank you again for this. This really helps



Hey Just Updating you on the situation. There has bee na slight mishap..my phone fell and i had to get a new
one..for now I cant get my data transferred so I dont have your phone number...
So if you need to contact me just text me saying its you.
Ill upload gamemaker files here soon so just hold up
Enjoy the night ;)
